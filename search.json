    "text": "Today we’ll learn about an ancient Germanic writing system, clean up some messy data, engineer a couple of simple features, and see if we can find a way to predict the age of some historical artifacts without having to pay for a fancy-schmancy archaeology degree. Along the way, we’ll get a little overview of the tidyverse and tidymodels approaches to data analysis and modeling in R.\n\n\nA rune is a letter from any of a handful of closely-related alphabets used by Germanic peoples primarily from around the 3rd to the 13th centuries CE. Like the Latin alphabet used to write the Germanic languages today, they derive from an ancient form of the Greek alphabet.1 These alphabets are sometimes called “futhark” (or “futhorc”, “fuþąrk”, etc.) after first few letters in their canonical order.2\nThe main runic alphabets are3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nMain Language(s)\nEra (c. CE)\nLetters\n\n\n\n\nElder Futhark\nProto-Germanic, Proto-Norse\n1st–8th\nᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚨ ᚱ ᚲ ᚷ ᚹ ᚺ ᚾ ᛁ ᛃ ᛈ ᛇ ᛉ ᛊ ᛏ ᛒ ᛖ ᛗ ᛚ\n\n\nAnglo-Frisian Futhorc\nOld Frisian, Old English\n5th–11th\nᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚩ ᚱ ᚳ ᚷ ᚹ ᚻ ᚾ ᛁ ᛡ ᛇ ᛈ ᛉ ᛋ ᛏ ᛒ ᛖ ᛗ ᛚ ᛝ ᛟ ᛞ ᚪ ᚫ ᛠ ᚣ\n\n\nYounger Futhark\nOld Norse\n8th–12th\nᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚬ ᚱ ᚴ ᚼ ᚾ ᛁ ᛅ ᛦ ᛋ ᛏ ᛒ ᛘ ᛚ\n\n\nMedieval Runes\nOld Icelandic, Old Swedish\n12th–17th\nᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚮ ᚱ ᚴ ᚼ ᚿ ᛁ ᛆ ᛌ ᛐ ᛒ ᛘ ᛚ ᛦ\n\n\n\nMagical incantations were sometimes written in runes, but despite what such august institutions as the gift shop of the National Museum of Iceland would have you believe, there’s no evidence that each runic letter had a specific symbolic meaning.4 Neither is there much evidence that they were used in divination. These alphabets were used mainly for mundane purposes such as inscribing an object with its owner or creator’s name, and for memorializing the dead on gravestones. Nevertheless, in recent times these alphabets have become an element in various kinds of New Age mysticism, neo-pagan religions, and unsavoury political movements.\n\n\n\nRuneS-DB is a database of artifacts bearing runic writing compiled from a variety of sources as part of RuneS, an overarching project to study these writing systems. It’s available from the RuneS project’s website.\n\nThe rights to the data are held by the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities and are subject to the CC-BY- SA law. The RuneS research units Göttingen, Eichstätt-München and Kiel were involved in the generation of the data. RuneS-DB contains data from the Kiel Runenprojekt, the Danish database runer.ku.dk and the Samnordisk runtextdatabas/Rundata accessible under the Open Database License (ODbL). Please also note the additional information on other origin of the data provided under the label sources.\n\nRuneS provides a tool on their website to query the database, but it’s pretty clunky. Instead, we’ll use R to see if we can learn anything interesting.\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the tidyverse collection of packages for manipulating and visualizing our data and the tidymodels packages to quickly define, train, and compare a few machine learning models. These packages “share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures” rooted in the “tidy data” principles originally espoused by Hadley Wickham.\nThis document was lovingly hand-crafted in artisanal, farm-to-table, GMO-free Quarto."

Because it’s amalgamated from many sources, information is coded inconsistently. A mix of languages are used, including in the column names. Getting this data set clean enough to start visualizing it is easy enough using dplyr functions like rename(), separate(), and mutate().\nThe first step is to make the column names more informative and get rid of the weird “rs_” and “rs_short_” prefixes.\n\nrunes_data |>\n  # rename the columns\n  rename(\n    find_number          = Findno,\n    inscription_name     = rs_short_inscr_name,\n    location             = rs_short_storage,\n    date                 = rs_extdat,\n    dating_method        = rs_short_dat_art,\n    context              = rs_short_context,\n    findspot             = rs_fundort,\n    object_class         = rs_objklasse,\n    object_type          = rs_objtyp,\n    object_complete      = rs_short_obj_complete,\n    material_class       = rs_short_matklasse,\n    material             = rs_mat,\n    object_state         = rs_short_obj_state,\n    writing_system       = rs_runenreihe,\n    museum               = rs_short_museum,\n    inscription_complete = rs_short_ins_complete,\n    translation          = rs_translat,\n    transliteration      = rs_translit,\n    inscription_state    = rs_short_ins_state,\n    markings             = rs_short_markings,\n    transcription        = rs_short_transkript,\n    names                = rs_namen,\n    find_year            = rs_fundjahr,\n    community            = rs_short_gemeinde,\n    district             = rs_short_bezirk,\n    region               = rs_short_landschaft,\n    country              = rs_short_land,\n    inventory_number     = rs_short_invnr,\n    category             = rs_short_kategorie,\n    shelf_marks          = rs_short_sigils,\n    carrier              = rs_traeger\n  ) ->\n  # update the dataframe\n  runes_data\n\nNext we’ll separate the location column into two columns, one with the general category and the other with the rest of the information.

Is there some rule you can use to estimate when they were carved (or written)?\nFirst, we need to consider what features of the object you’d be able to determine. I think these are all reasonable:\n\nobject class (stone, coin, etc.)\nmaterial class (stone, metal, wood, etc.)\ncountry\nwriting system (elder futhark, anglo-frisian futhorc, etc.)\nlength of the inscription\nwhether the inscription contains an abecedarium; something like “fuþarkgw…” or “abcdefgh…”\nwhether the inscription seems to contain any of a few common words or morphemes\n\nThe first four of these features are already present in our data frame. We’ll have to “engineer” the others.\nUnfortunately, the transliterations in RuneS-DB are very inconsistently encoded, but we can still get an approximate length of each inscription by converting the transliteration to ASCII10 and counting the number of resulting alphanumeric characters11. It’s too bad the database doesn’t simply use the runic characters included in Unicode, but perhaps that wouldn’t be sufficient to encode parts of the inscriptions which are unclear, damaged, combined into ligatures (so-called “bind runes”), etc.\n\nrunes_data |>\n  mutate(\n    inscription_length =\n      transliteration |>\n      # convert to ASCII\n      iconv(to = \"ASCII//TRANSLIT\") |>\n      # count alphanumeric characters\n      str_count(\"[[:lower:]\\\\?]\")) ->\n  runes_data\n\nWe can identify abecedaria by slightly re-encoding the “category” column.\n\nrunes_data |>\n  mutate(\n    abecedarium = case_when(\n      str_detect(category, \"alphabet\") ~ \"abc\",\n      str_detect(category, \"row\") ~ \"futh\",\n      TRUE ~ \"no\")) ->\n  runes_data\n\nAnother feature we can derive from the inscription is what kind of spacing is used between words.\n\nrunes_data |>\n  mutate(\n    spaces = case_when(\n      str_detect(transliteration, \" [÷\\\\*\\\\+] \") ~ \"crosses/stars\",\n      str_detect(transliteration, \" × \") ~ \"crosses/stars\",\n      str_detect(transliteration, \" [ˈ\\\\.] \") ~ \"single dots\",\n      str_detect(transliteration, \" : \") ~ \"double dots\",\n      TRUE ~ \"none/other\")) ->\n  runes_data\n\nFinally let’s encode the presence or absence of a few of the most common words/morphemes.\n\nrunes_data |>\n  mutate(\n    sin_sun_syn = str_detect(transliteration, \"sin|sun|syn\"),\n    auk_uk_ok   = str_detect(transliteration, \"auk|uk|ok\"),\n    at          = str_detect(transliteration, \"at\"),\n#   fathur      = str_detect(transliteration, \"faþur\"),\n    stain_stin  = str_detect(transliteration, \"stain|stin|stӕin\"),\n    lit         = str_detect(transliteration, \"lit\"),\n    across(sin_sun_syn:lit, as.numeric)) ->\n  runes_data\n\nIs this enough information to be able to predict the age of a runic inscription with any accuracy?

In both cases we’ll normalize our numeric predictor. Some model types require categorical predictors to be dummy-encoded, while others can exhibit better performance with categorical predictors left as-is. We’ll try both ways.\n\n# create a pre-processing recipe\nrecipe(runes_data) |>\n  update_role(date, new_role = \"outcome\") |>\n  update_role(1:(ncol(runes_data) - 1), new_role = \"predictor\") |>\n  # normalize the numeric feature\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |>\n  # dummy encode the categorical features\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) ->\n  runes_recipe\n\n\n\nBaseline\nNow we can define our models. First let’s “fit” the null model, which consists of just always guessing the mean date value from the training set. It’s straightforward to simply calculate the appropriate RMSE estimate in this case, but for illustrative purposes we’ll use cross-validation anyway. It doesn’t matter which recipe we use since the null model ignores the predictors anyway.\n\nnull_model() |>\n  set_engine(\"parsnip\") |>\n  set_mode(\"regression\") ->\n  null_spec\n\nworkflow() |>\n  add_model(null_spec) |>\n  add_recipe(runes_recipe) |>\n  fit_resamples(resamples = folds, metrics = metric_set(rmse)) |>\n  collect_metrics() |>\n  pull(mean)\n\n[1] 311.4979\n\n\nThe null model’s prediction is, in a certain sense, off by more than three centuries on average. Surely we can do better than that.\n\n\nThe Bias-Variance Trade-off\n\n\nModel Specification\nWe’ll try six more kinds of model. Each comes with some hyperparameters which control the bias-variance tradeoff, the step size for gradient descent, etc. We can leave tune() as a placeholder for these values when creating the model specifications. When we fit the models, we’ll try 10 combinations of hyperparameter values for each model type, and keep only the best ones.\nA linear model assumes the outcome is a linear function of the predictors and finds the best coefficient to assign to each. Linear models are inflexible, and so tend to suffer from bias (unless the underlying relationship really is approximately linear), but they tend to have lower variance than more flexible model types, since their outputs are not too sensitive to small changes in their inputs. The penalty and mixture hyperparameters here control how much L1 (LASSO) and/or L2 (ridge) regularization to apply. Regularization penalizes more complex models in order to prevent overfitting.\n\nlinear_reg(\n  engine  = \"glmnet\",\n  penalty = tune(),\n  mixture = tune()) ->\n  linear_spec\n\nA decision tree is essentially a flowchart, with each split corresponding to a rule in the form of an “if/then” condition on a predictor. The idea is to find the splits which best separate the outcome. Predictions are produced by taking the average outcome among the training data belonging to the relevant terminal node of the tree. tree_depth specifies the maximum depth of the tree; without some maximum, the training data could be completely interpolated (or “memorized”), an extreme form of overfitting. cost_complexity controls how well a split must separate its subset of the training data in order to be considered, and min_n controls how much training data must belong to a node in order to justify any further splitting.\n\ndecision_tree(engine     = \"partykit\",\n              tree_depth = tune(),\n              min_n      = tune()) ->\n  decision_tree_spec\n\nNearest neighbours models predict that the value of the outcome for a test data point will be some kind of weighted average of that point’s nearest neighbours in the training data. neighbors controls the number of neighbours to consider and the other hyperparameters specify the precise notions of “weighted average” and “nearest” to use.\n\nnearest_neighbor(engine      = \"kknn\",\n                 neighbors   = tune(),\n                 weight_func = tune(),\n                 dist_power  = tune()) ->\n  nearest_neighbours_spec\n\nBoosted tree ensembles are a very popular machine learning approach involving fitting many small decision trees, each of which is optimized to improve the predictions obtained by combining the preceding trees. This model type inherents the hyperparameters involved in fitting decision trees, plus additional hyperparameters specifying the number of trees to use, the proportion of training data and number of predictors to consider at each step during fitting, as well as how much weight to initially apply to each new tree.\n\nboost_tree(engine         = \"xgboost\",\n           trees          = 1000,\n           tree_depth     = tune(),\n           min_n          = tune(),\n           loss_reduction = tune(),\n           sample_size    = tune(),\n           mtry           = tune(),\n           learn_rate     = tune()) ->\n  boosted_trees_spec\n\nSome approaches combine multiple other types of models. Cubist involves a tree ensemble with linear models fit on each tree node, a boosting-like procedure, and a final nearest-neighbours-based adjustment.\n\ncubist_rules(engine = \"Cubist\",\n             committees = tune(),\n             neighbors = tune()) ->\n  cubist_spec\n\n\n\nModel Fitting\nIn tidymodels, a “workflow” is an object which bundles together a model specification together with any associated pre-processing recipes, hyperparameter values, and/or evaluation results. workflow_set and workflow_map allow us to tune all of our model specifications as a batch.\n\n# combine the model specifications in a list\nlist(linear        = linear_spec,\n     tree          = decision_tree_spec,\n     nn            = nearest_neighbours_spec,\n     boosted_trees = boosted_trees_spec,\n     cubist        = cubist_spec) ->\n  runes_model_specs\n\n# set the prediction mode of each engine to \"regression\"\nrunes_model_specs |>\n  map(~set_mode(., \"regression\")) ->\n  runes_model_specs\n\n# combine pre-processing recipe and model specifications into a workflow set\nworkflow_set(preproc = list(recipe = runes_recipe),\n             models = runes_model_specs) ->\n  runes_workflow_set\n\nrunes_workflow_set |>\n  # for each model specification, try ten combinations of tuning parameters\n  # and estimate rmse using cross-validation\n  workflow_map(\"tune_grid\",\n               resamples = folds,\n               grid = 10,\n               metrics = metric_set(rmse)) ->\n  # update the workflow set with the results\n  runes_workflow_set\n\n\n\nPerformance Comparison\nNow our workflow set contains ten fit models per model type for each of ten hyperparameter combinations. We can extract the best version of each model type and plot the cross-validated performance estimates.\n\n# plot the rmse estimate from the best iteration of each type of model\nrank_results(runes_workflow_set, select_best = TRUE) |>\n  group_by(model) |>\n  slice_max(mean) |>\n  select(mean, std_err, model) |>\n  rename(rmse_mean = mean, rmse_std_err = std_err) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(model, -desc(rmse_mean)), y = rmse_mean)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rmse_mean - rmse_std_err,\n                    ymax = rmse_mean + rmse_std_err),\n                width = 0.1,\n                size = 1.5,\n                color = \"#595959\") +\n  labs(x = \"Model Type\",\n       y = \"Estimated RMSE\",\n       title = \"Estimated RMSE for Best Model of Each Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that Cubist and boosted trees models work best for these data. Let’s finalize a Cubist model by re-fitting the best one on the entire training set, and seeing how well it predicts the age of artifacts in the test set.\n\nrunes_workflow_set |>\n  # get the cubist workflow\n  extract_workflow(\"recipe_cubist\") |>\n  # get the best cubist hyperparameters and apply them to the workflow\n  finalize_workflow(\n    runes_workflow_set |>\n      extract_workflow_set_result(\"recipe_cubist\") |>\n      select_best(metric = \"rmse\")) |>\n  # fit on the entire training set\n  last_fit(split, metrics = metric_set(rmse)) ->\n  final_cubist\n\n\n\nThe Performance-Explainability Trade-off\nUnfortunately, our finalized Cubist model is useless. Since we’re lost in the woods, we can’t actually compute a prediction involving a complicated collection of trees of linear models with hundreds or thousands of coefficients and weights in total.\nCan we find a simple decision tree with comparable performance by trying more hyperparameter combinations? Let’s set tree_depth to 3, find good values for the other hyperparameters, then finalize and evaluate the resulting decision tree model.\n\ndecision_tree_spec |>\n  set_args(tree_depth = 3) |>\n  set_mode(\"regression\") ->\n  decision_tree_spec\n\nworkflow() |>\n  add_model(decision_tree_spec) |>\n  add_recipe(runes_recipe) |>\n  # try 100 combinations of cost_complexity and min_n\n  tune_grid(resamples = folds, metrics = metric_set(rmse), grid = 100) |>\n  # keep the best ones\n  select_best(metric = \"rmse\") |>\n  # plug them back into the model specification\n  finalize_workflow(\n    workflow() |> \n      add_model(decision_tree_spec) |>\n      add_recipe(runes_recipe),\n    parameters = _) |>\n  # fit on the entire training set\n  last_fit(split, metrics = metric_set(rmse)) ->\n  small_tree\n\nNow we have two finalized models: a Cubist model and a small decision tree. The most obvious way to compare them would be to inspect their performance, but we can also use the vip package to extract the number of features used by each model, giving us a way to compare their relative complexity as well.\n\ndata.frame(\n  model    = c(\"Cubist\", \"Small Decision Tree\"),\n  rmse     = c(final_cubist |> collect_metrics() |> pull(.estimate), \n               small_tree   |> collect_metrics() |> pull(.estimate)),\n  features = c(final_cubist |> extract_fit_engine() |> vi() |> filter(Importance > 0) |> nrow(),\n               small_tree   |> extract_fit_engine() |> vi() |> filter(Importance > 0) |> nrow())) |>\n  kbl() |>\n  scroll_box(width = \"51.75%\")\n\n\n\n \n  \n    model \n    rmse \n    features \n  \n \n\n  \n    Cubist \n    109.7088 \n    38 \n  \n  \n    Small Decision Tree \n    131.1698 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe small decision tree’s predictions are about 16% worse than the best Cubist model we could find. On the other hand, it’s much simpler. While the Cubist model uses essentially all of the information we provided to it, since we constrained our decision tree to three levels, it can use only a maximum of seven features.12 Although the more complicated Cubist performs well, it’s difficult to explain exactly why, or what the role of each feature is in generating predictions. This illustrates the performance-explainability trade-off.\nOur small tree model is simple enough to write on an index card and keep with us when venturing out into the forests of rural Scandinavia. Here it is:\n\nsmall_tree |>\n  extract_fit_engine() |>\n  as.simpleparty() |>\n  plot(\n    ip_args = list(pval = FALSE, id = FALSE),\n    tp_args = list(\n      id = FALSE, \n      FUN = function(node){round(node$prediction[1])}))"

    "text": "Homeworlds is an abstract space battle game designed by John Cooper and published by Looney Labs. It’s played with multipurpose game pieces called Looney pyramids, three of each of combination of three sizes (small, medium, and large) and four colours (green, yellow, blue, and red) for 36 in total. A pyramid lying down is a space ship and a pyramid standing up is a star. Each colour is associated with an ability.\nAt the beginning of the game, each player chooses two stars to be their homeworld. Star systems are connected if they have no sizes in common.\n\n\n\nHomeworlds star connection rule (from Looney Labs)\n\n\nExpert players actively debate Homeworlds’ opening theory. One question is which combination of star sizes should be selected by the first player, and how the second player should respond.\n\n\n\nSome homeworld options (from Looney Labs)\n\n\nWhen players’ homeworlds are one step away from one another (i.e. connected), this is known as a “microverse”. If they are two steps away, that’s a “small universe”, and if they are three steps away, that’s a “large universe”.\nIn addition to their homeworld stars, each player selects a pyramid to be their first ship. The rest of the pieces become the bank from which new stars and ships are taken and to which destroyed stars and ships are returned."

    "text": "Modelling First Player Advantage\nWe can model first player advantage by imagining that a game of Homeworlds is like a biased coin flip, where each opening is associated with an independent bias. For example, if the bias parameter for some opening is 0.6, then we expect the first player to win 60% of the time that opening is played.1\nIf this parameter is distributed according to a beta distribution Beta(a, b), then its posterior distribution accounting for observing n wins and m losses for the first player is Beta(a + n, b + m).2 All that is left is to decide on a prior distribution representing our beliefs before observing any data. This is an interesting subtlety3, but it seems reasonable to choose a uniform prior, Beta(1, 1), under which all possibilities are equally credible.\nFrom the posterior distribution, we can construct a 90% credible interval using qbeta. Unlike the confidence intervals used in frequentist statistical inference, which are the source of much confusion, Bayesian credible intervals have a straightforward interpretation: we’re 90% sure the true value of the parameter is contained in a 90% credible interval.4\nWe can also calculate the probability that the first player is favoured (i.e. is expected to win at least half the time) in each opening using pbeta. In this case we don’t consider the extent of the advantage, just whether there is one.\n\n\nCode\nhomeworlds_openings |&gt;\n  mutate(across(c(p1_hw, p2_hw), \n                \\(x) factor(x, ordered = T, levels = hw_sizes))) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(p1_wins = n*p1_wr,\n         p2_wins = n*(1 - p1_wr),\n         # calculate a 90% credible interval from the posterior distribution\n         ci_lower = qbeta(c(0.05, 0.95), 1 + p1_wins, 1 + p2_wins)[1],\n         ci_upper = qbeta(c(0.05, 0.95), 1 + p1_wins, 1 + p2_wins)[2],\n         # format the interval as text\n         formatted_ci = paste0(round(100 * ci_lower),\n                               \"-\",\n                               round(100 * ci_upper),\n                               \"%\"),\n         # bold intervals that do not contain 50%\n         ci_fontface = case_when(!between(0.5, ci_lower, ci_upper) ~ \"bold\",\n                                 T ~ \"plain\"),\n         universe_size = universe_size(p1_hw, p2_hw),\n         universe_size = factor(universe_size, \n                                ordered = TRUE, \n                                levels = universe_sizes),\n         prob_fav = 1 - pbeta(0.5, 1 + p1_wins, 1 + p2_wins),\n         formatted_prob_fav = case_when(\n           prob_fav &lt; 0.005 ~ \"&lt;1%\",\n           prob_fav &lt; 0.995 ~ paste0(round(100 * prob_fav), \"%\"),\n           T ~ \"&gt;99%\"),\n         prob_fav_fontface = case_when(abs(prob_fav - 0.5) &gt; 0.45 ~ \"bold\", \n                                       T ~ \"plain\")) |&gt;\n  arrange(p1_hw, p2_hw) -&gt;\n  visualization_data\n\nvisualization_data |&gt;\n  select(p1_hw, p2_hw, formatted_ci, prob_fav) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(p1_hw = \"First Player\",\n             p2_hw = \"Second Player\",\n             formatted_ci = html(\"First Player Advantage&lt;br&gt;90% Credible Interval\"),\n             prob_fav = html(\"Probability of&lt;br&gt;First Player Advantage\")) |&gt;\n  tab_spanner(label = md(\"**Homeworld Sizes**\"), columns = 1:2) |&gt;\n  cols_align(align = \"center\", columns = everything()) |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"First Player Advantage in Homeworlds Openings\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"500px\") |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      First Player Advantage in Homeworlds Openings\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        Homeworld Sizes\n      \n      First Player Advantage90% Credible Interval\n      Probability ofFirst Player Advantage\n    \n    \n      First Player\n      Second Player\n    \n  \n  \n    SM\nSM\n60-69%\n0.999999680\n    SM\nSL\n45-52%\n0.248413661\n    SM\nML\n47-52%\n0.387849078\n    SM\nSS\n25-90%\n0.687849323\n    SM\nMM\n32-51%\n0.061530777\n    SM\nLL\n40-62%\n0.556708384\n    SL\nSM\n41-49%\n0.013054745\n    SL\nSL\n53-67%\n0.991093430\n    SL\nML\n46-54%\n0.533008043\n    SL\nSS\n34-87%\n0.773895167\n    SL\nMM\n21-61%\n0.212754245\n    SL\nLL\n33-63%\n0.423357565\n    ML\nSM\n44-50%\n0.066035425\n    ML\nSL\n50-58%\n0.935076177\n    ML\nML\n55-64%\n0.999647706\n    ML\nSS\n26-58%\n0.202200438\n    ML\nMM\n26-55%\n0.132786582\n    ML\nLL\n31-58%\n0.249135577\n    SS\nSM\n8-36%\n0.001698437\n    SS\nSL\n14-53%\n0.081930335\n    SS\nML\n8-47%\n0.032714844\n    SS\nSS\n29-81%\n0.635929076\n    SS\nMM\n17-83%\n0.500000000\n    SS\nLL\n8-66%\n0.187500000\n    MM\nSM\n52-73%\n0.973623861\n    MM\nSL\n56-87%\n0.986698151\n    MM\nML\n57-77%\n0.996318685\n    MM\nSS\n34-87%\n0.773895167\n    MM\nMM\n40-69%\n0.704614834\n    MM\nLL\n34-83%\n0.746093750\n    LL\nSM\n60-81%\n0.998935554\n    LL\nSL\n38-60%\n0.448433249\n    LL\nML\n54-71%\n0.991765439\n    LL\nSS\n48-95%\n0.937298892\n    LL\nMM\n61-96%\n0.989278600\n    LL\nLL\n41-58%\n0.462032892"

    "text": "Observations\nIt seems that the first player should probably choose a large-large or medium-medium homeworld configuration. A homeworld with equally-sized stars is known as a “Gemini” configuration. When the first player chooses a Gemini opening, the second player loses the option of creating a large universe; only a small or a microverse is possible.\nThe second player should opt for a small universe rather than a microverse. (A large universe is not possible when the first player’s homeworld contains stars of equal size.)\nWhy isn’t small-small also advantageous for the first player? This is likely due to creating a bank configuration which will provide better lines of play to the second player in the early turns of the game."

This is a relatively minor issue, however, since a certain combination of colours5 is almost universally chosen.\nMore concerning is the potentially confounding effect of player skill. It’s very possible that some openings may be effective only in the hands of experts. It would be interesting to revisit this analysis with more granular and detailed data that included Elo ratings. You can help with this by learning Homeworlds!\nYou can buy a Homeworlds set from Looney Labs. The same pieces can also be used to play many other interesting games."

    "text": "Homeworlds is an abstract space battle game designed by John Cooper and published by Looney Labs. It’s played with multipurpose game pieces called Looney pyramids, three of each of combination of three sizes (small, medium, and large) and four colours (green, yellow, blue, and red) for 36 in total. A pyramid lying down is a space ship and a pyramid standing up is a star. Each colour is associated with an ability.\nAt the beginning of the game, each player chooses two stars to be their homeworld. Star systems are connected if they have no sizes in common.\n\n\n\nHomeworlds star connection rule (from Looney Labs)\n\n\nExpert players actively debate Homeworlds’ opening theory. One question is which combination of star sizes should be selected by the first player, and how the second player should respond.\n\n\n\nSome homeworld options (from Looney Labs)\n\n\nWhen players’ homeworlds are one step away from one another (i.e. connected), this is known as a “microverse”. If they are two steps away, that’s a “small universe”, and if they are three steps away, that’s a “large universe”.\nIn addition to their homeworld stars, each player selects a pyramid to be their first ship. The rest of the pieces become the bank from which new stars and ships are taken and to which destroyed stars and ships are returned."
